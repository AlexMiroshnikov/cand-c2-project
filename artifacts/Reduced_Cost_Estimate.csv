"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."


The main idea of cost reduction is to switch from on-demand to reserved capacities for EC2 and RDS.
